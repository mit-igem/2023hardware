Documentation for eTube Rotator:

In this file, you will find all of the necessary tools needed to replicate the Eppendorf Tube Spinner we used in a few of our experiments. 

Included in this folder are:
1. a video of the final product at work
2. the full code used to program the arduino
3. the circuit schematic for the hardware
4. the stl files for the 3D printed parts
5. photos (labeled) of the hardware 


To complete this project you will need: 
- Arduino Uno board x1
- L298N Motor Driver (H-Bridge) x1
- DC Motor 1x
- 3D Printer with filament (we used PLA) 
- Soldering iron + Solder
- Wire Stripper (or scissors)
- Wire 
- Power Source that can be split in two
